## Welcome to my GitHub!

While completing my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, I was exposed to wealth of information.  We focused on the software development lifecycle, data structures, algorithms, databases, webservers, front end development, team collaboration, data mining, and coding securely. Throughout my program, I have gained an in-depth understanding of MySQL and MongoDB, including their strengths and weaknesses.  I have also learned how to write webservers to communicate to these databases as an intermediatory between a front-end development and the database, I have written and used several webservers to communicate via Python.  I am well versed in data structures and data handling.  I am fluent in Git and understand the importance of team collaboration in competing a project, I used this frequently while creating a shared playlist application.  I have developed high level knowledge of requirements definitions, use case diagrams, and functional diagrams, which are essential to planning large projects.  I mapped out a student class registration program using these methods.  I have learned common security concerns with various languages, how to mitigate them, and how to detect them during debugging.  I have also learned the importance of various levels of testing done on a program to ensure both functionality and security.   My portfolio showcases my understanding of several of these topics.  

 The main artifact, a full stack application tailored to a small business, shows my strengths and practicality as a software engineer.  Here I designed the application from a high level, created the individual moving parts, tested, and pushed it.  We start with a UI tailored to the business with the main concept of reachability and simplicity in mind, while adding elements that were personalized to the business model.  From here, we go into several different layers of the application all designed for the various business operations.  These layers make http requests to a web server which communicates with a database.  The database was designed in a way that allows flexibility and the ability to be easily added upon in the event of the business owner requests additional features.  It was also designed to be flexible in certain manners and to allow for easy data extrapolation using aggregate pipelines.  The most practical and useful part of this application was the design of an algorithm that sends requests to Google’s Maps API to optimize delivery routes so the business owners can operate their fleet in the most efficient and cost-effective manner.  My goal with this application is to show my ability to work with various different languages and technologies to create business solutions that work.  The business owners will reap the benefits of this application and save time and money in the long run all while keeping themselves organized.


## My Delivery Route Tracker/Optimizer/Invoicing Application

Dahl's Dairy is an application custom built for a local glass bottle milk delivery.  The purpose of this application is to organize delivery routes, customer information, invoice customers, and to optimize the route stop for effeciency.

### Google Maps API

The route optimization feature is meant to save companies time and costs by leveageing Google's Maps API to iteratively search through their a list of customeres and rearranging them so deliveries can be made in the most time effecient manner.
